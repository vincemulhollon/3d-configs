# 3d-configs
These are standard configs for my 3d printing workflow on freebsd

cd ~/Dropbox/printrbot
git clone https://github.com/vincemulhollon/3d-configs configs

(I have Dropbox on freebsd because I run openafs home dirs, and have dropbox running on some legacy box)

makefile.standard includes some installation commentary for various 3d printing software on FreeBSD

slic3r.ini.standard is for my printrbot simple metal with heated bed printing 1.75mm PLA on kapton
